# Week 1 tasks

1. Take a stab at installing the environment on your local machine ([Instructions](course_documents/install_jupyter_notebook.md))
  * If you get too bogged down in this, you can skip this for now and use
  one of the two alternatives for running the notebooks.
2. Go through the `Python Basics` and `Some first mining` notebooks that
we used in class. Just to get comfortable.
  * You might want to also try the versions of these notebooks in Tactic.
3. Try the `Solo Work 1` notebook.
4. Work through Chapters 1-7 in "Python From the Very Beginning". Don't feel
like you have to do everything. Try what seems helpful.
